# Hidden-Blast
Hidden Blast is a browser-based turn-based bomb survival game where you and the computer secretly select bombs and take turns clicking tiles to test your luck. If a player hits the opponent’s hidden bomb, they instantly lose — otherwise the game continues until the maximum turns are reached or a draw is declared.
